                    <strong>Did You Know?</strong>
                    <br><br>More than half of Talisay City College students, 54% of the students spend 5 hours or more on social media every day. This level of daily exposure means students are constantly feeding algorithmic systems with data about their clicks, likes, interests, and habits.
                    <br><br>The longer you stay online, the more accurately the algorithm predicts what you will enjoy, follow, and eventually buy. Every scroll teaches the system what you’re likely to engage with next.
                    <br><br>If you’ve ever wondered why the “perfect product” keeps showing up on your feed, it’s because the algorithm already knows what you like.

                    <br><br>Each like, view, or skip shapes the kind of sponsored content that appears next. This creates a cycle where the algorithm becomes better at serving you discounts, trends, and products you’re most likely to purchase.
                    <br><br>Your feed isn’t random. It’s engineered to influence what you want before you even know you want it.

                    <br><br>Students who see more targeted content are more likely to:
                    <br>• Buy more often
                    <br>• Spend more money
                    <br>• Make impulse purchases
                    <br><br>Algorithms don’t just show content, they shape decisions, spending habits, and even perceived needs. College students, especially those with limited allowances, are more vulnerable to algorithm driven recommendations.

                    <strong>1. Strengthen Algorithm Awareness</strong>
                    <br>Know that every tap, swipe, and pause helps the algorithm understand you.
                    
                    <br><br><strong>2. Practice Conscious Spending</strong>
                    <br>Ask yourself:
                    <br>• “Do I need this?”
                    <br>• “Is this within my budget?”
                    <br>• “Is this something I discovered or something the algorithm pushed?”
                    
                    <br><br><strong>3. Limit Exposure to High-Influence Triggers</strong>
                    <br>These include:
                    <br>• Flash sales
                    <br>• Influencer recommendations
                    <br>• Algorithm-curated product lists
                    <br>• TikTok Shop or Instagram Shop feeds

                    <br><br><strong>4. Use Tools That Protect You</strong>
                    <br>These include:
                    <br>• Ad blockers
                    <br>• Screen time controls
                    <br>• Wishlists (delay purchases instead of buying instantly)
                    
                    <br><br><strong>5. Improve Digital Literacy</strong>
                    <br>Understanding how platforms work reduces the risk of being unconsciously influenced.
